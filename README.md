Ori Assistant is a Linux-based TUI (Text User Interface) AI assistant that integrates with OpenRouter API, offering powerful plugins, an advanced command-line interface, and modern UI capabilities. It is designed for both beginner and advanced users, with plugin support and a modular structure for easy extensions.

## Features

- **Slash Commands**: Internal commands are now prefixed with a forward slash (e.g., `/help`, `/quit`).
- **Secure API Key Handling**: API key is encrypted and stored in `~/.config/ori/key` using the motherboard's fingerprint for added security.
- **Clear Command**: A `/clear` command has been added to clear the terminal screen.
- **Update Check**: The assistant now silently checks for updates on startup and provides a `--check-for-updates` flag for manual checks. The update process now downloads the pre-compiled binary.
- **Agentic Command Execution**: The AI can intelligently decide to run shell commands to answer questions or perform tasks. For safety, it always asks for user confirmation in interactive mode.
- **TUI AI Assistant**: Text-based interface for interacting with AI models
- **OpenRouter API Integration**: Connects to various AI models through OpenRouter
- **Default Model**: Deepseek R1 Free as the default AI model
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture with plugin support
- **Orpm Plugin Manager**: Built-in package manager for plugins with JSON-based plugin database
- **Session Context**: Remembers conversation history in interactive mode
- **System Prompt**: The system prompt is now a constant string in the C++ code.
- **Cross-Platform Build System**: CMake-based build system with dependency management

## Current Implementation Status

This project is currently at version 0.4.

### Core Components

1. **OriAssistant**: Main TUI interface with command processing
2. **OpenRouterAPI**: API interface (placeholder implementation)
3. **Orpm**: Plugin manager with full install/remove/search/list functionality
4. **Plugin Database**: JSON-based plugin metadata system

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++14 compatible compiler (GCC 5.0+ or Clang 3.4+)
- CMake 3.10+
- OpenRouter API key (for production use)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chafiq-dev/ORI.git
cd ORI

# Build using the provided script
./build.sh

# Or build manually
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The build script will automatically handle the build process and create the executable in the `build/` directory.

## Configuration

### API Key Setup

1. **Get an Openrouter API Key**: from [here](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)
2. **Set the key**:

   Ori Assistant can load your OpenRouter API key from multiple sources:
   
     #### 1. Environment Variable:
     Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in your shell profile:
   
      ```bash
      export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
      ```
   
     #### 2. Encrypted File:
     Run `ori` for the first time and it will ask you to enter your API key, which will be encrypted and stored in `~/.config/ori/key`.

## Usage

### Running the Assistant

```bash
# Start the interactive assistant (from build directory)
./build/ori

# Show help
./build/ori --help

# Show version
./build/ori --version

# Run a non-interactive command, auto-approving any shell execution
./build/ori -y "install nmap for me"
```

In the interactive mode:
- Type any query to get a response
- Type `/help` to see available commands
- Type `/quit` to exit
- Type `/clear` to clear the screen

### Using the Plugin Manager (orpm)

`orpm` is now a separate bash script that wraps the `ori --orpm` command.

```bash
# List available plugins
orpm --orpm-list

# List installed plugins
orpm --orpm-list-installed

# Search for plugins
orpm --orpm-search "voice"

# Install a plugin (placeholder implementation)
orpm --orpm-install "voice-chat"

# Remove a plugin (placeholder implementation)
orpm --orpm-remove "voice-chat"
```

## Plugin System

### Plugin Locations

- **User Plugins**: `~/.local/share/ori/plugins/`
- **System Plugins**: `/usr/share/ori/plugins/` (requires sudo access)

### Plugin Database

Plugins are managed through a JSON database (`plugins/plugin_database.json`) that contains:
- Plugin name and version
- Description and developer information
- Git repository URL
- Download URL for plugin archives

### Available Plugins (Demo)

1. **voice-chat**: Voice interaction plugin
2. **shell-access**: Shell command execution with safety features
3. **custom-prompt**: Customizable shell prompt
4. **file-access**: File system access capabilities
5. **gtk4-ui**: Graphical user interface (planned)
6. **text-editor**: Integrated text editor (planned)

## Security Considerations

- API keys are loaded securely from environment variables or configuration files
- Plugins are sandboxed (planned implementation)
- User and system plugin directories are separated for security
- Plugin installation requires explicit user action

## Development
